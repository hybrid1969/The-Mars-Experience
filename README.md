## Challenge Description ![NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016](http://i.imgur.com/0xwKStM.png)

> Create a custom world map generator module using a gaming framework or engine of your choice that leverages altimeter, terrain and imagery data to render realistic worlds.  This will involve the use of a World Map Tile Service client to leverage over 1 TB of Mars and Vesta data for use in world generation.

## How we solved it

![Workflow](http://i.imgur.com/CzGkzgd.png "Workflow")

Over the course of the 48 hours hack, we created an immersive experience using Google Cardboard and Unity3D to recreate mars in virtual reallity enviroment. Now **everyone can enjoy mars**!

The red planet was constructed using the terrain and map information extracted from Mars Trek WMTS Layer Service and JPT Maps. To make the experience more educational we added information about mars moons and the sun. The martian weather was created based on the data transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on Mars! We also added the Curiosity Rover as a 3D object to show info about it. You can even see the last image taken from the [real rover](http://i.imgur.com/o1mL1vN.jpg).

## Look into the Future 

We choose **#openworldgeneration** challenge because we want all of you to live ***THE MARS EXPERIENCE***. Travel further than you ever have without leaving your room. Experience and learn about mars in the first person without difficulty, hazard or any inconvenience. ~~[In your face Matt Damon!](http://i.imgur.com/4zw8u9M.jpg)~~

### Mars is just the beginning, we have a whole universe to explore, and we don't even need to be astronatus.

> ####Open World Generation using NASA Mars and Vesta Data

> **#openworldgeneration**

> Create a custom world map generator module using a gaming framework or engine of your choice that leverages altimeter, terrain and imagery data to render realistic worlds.  This will involve the use of a World Map Tile Service client to leverage over 1 TB of Mars and Vesta data for use in world generation.

## The idea

## How we solved it

Over the course of the 48-hour challenge, we created an immersive experience using Google Cardboard and Unity3D to recreate Mars in virtual reality enviroment. Now **everyone can enjoy Mars**! [*](http://i.imgur.com/BT9tNyH.jpg)

The Virtual Red Planet was constructed using the terrain and map information extracted from Mars Trek WMTS Layer Service and JPT Maps. To make the experience educational we added information about the Moons of Mars and the Sun. The martian weather was created based on the data transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on Mars! We also added the Curiosity Rover as a 3D object to show info about it. You can even see the last image taken from [the real rover](http://i.imgur.com/SF302fs.jpg).

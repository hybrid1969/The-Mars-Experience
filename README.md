## Challenge Description

> Create a custom world map generator module using a gaming framework or engine of your choice that leverages altimeter, terrain and imagery data to render realistic worlds.  This will involve the use of a World Map Tile Service client to leverage over 1 TB of Mars and Vesta data for use in world generation.

#Bring it on!

## How we solved it

We created an immersive experience using Google Cardboard and Unity3D to recreate mars in virtual reallity enviroment. Now everyone can enjoy mars!

The red planet was constructed using the terrain and map information extracted from Mars Trek WMTS Layer Service and JPT Maps. To make the experience more educational we added information about mars moons and the sun. The martian weather changes in real time using the MAAS API that uses REMS weather data being transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on Mars! We also added the Curiosity Rover as a 3D object to show info about it. You can even see the last image taken from the real rover.
